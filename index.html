							<h2>About Me</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>For years coding was my favorite part of school and work, and now I can make it every part!

								I'm a software engineer trained in Javascript, Python, SQL, PostgreSQL, Sequelize, Express, React, Redux,  Node.js, HTML5, CSS3, and more.  I love learning new technologies and using them immediately to solve problems or build creative and useful apps and projects, as well as helping others and debugging.

								Formally, I was an Aerospace Test Engineer working in the eVTOL industry.

								I'm looking to apply my skills in a fast-paced environment, learning every day and consistently using that new knowledge to solidify my skills and contribute to a project I believe in.

								You'll also find me trying to make the people around me laugh, and settling for myself when my jokes bomb. I'll be here all week.</p>

							<h2>Skills</h2>

						<div class="content">
							<p>Here are some of the many skills I've picked up in the various engineering fields:</p>
							<ul class="feature-icons">
								<li class="icon solid fa-laptop">Web-Development</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-bolt">Fast-Paced Prototyping and Delivery</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-signal">Communication</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-cog">Group Work</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-map-marker-alt">German Language</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-code">JavaScript, Python, React, Redux, SQL, and more!</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Both my test engineer background and software development experience make me and excellent communicator, who knows the value of a direct and clear approach, especially in group settings. Working at a start-up and through App Academy gave me the skills to work in incredibly fast-paced environments with narrow turn around windows.  </p>

										<h3>Brandon</h3>
										<p>Throughout our study together, Niels has impressed me with his creative solutions on numerous occasions. Whether it's through group discussions or one-on-one pair programming sessions, Niels always brings his out-of-box thinking to the table. Definitely an engineer I hope to work with more in the future.

										<h3>Jing Jing</h3>
										<p>I have worked with many professionals, but Niels was a unique one to work with. He is one of the most dedicated professionals I’ve worked with and is willing to put that extra help whenever you need it. Niels has a solid knowledge base so he could always provide me with a more efficient way to solve problems. His ability to tackle any problem is remarkable. I highly recommend and endorse Niels.</p>

										<h3>Matilda</h3>
										<p>I specifically requested Niels to be on my team for my second group project in App Academy because I knew he'd be an invaluable team member, and needless to say, he did not disappoint. He was known widely for his uncanny ability to immediately pick up and master new material as well as his enthusiasm with providing help to whoever asked for it. Having him on your side gives you a sense of security and confidence that you'll be able to execute whatever it is you're working on, and I was lucky enough to experience this firsthand. His personable demeanor and altruism, combined with his coding expertise and general intelligence, will make him an indispensable asset to any team.</p>
